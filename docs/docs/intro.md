# Editor Helper tools documentation

In this website I'll try to explain all the tools inside **Editor Helper**.

## What is Editor Helper?

**Editor Helper** is a Unturned 3 module designing to make the life of map makers easier.

It's a fully open source module, at the moment only maintained by **[Senior S](https://github.com/Senior-S)**.

All the features the module contains, have been requested to Nelson by the community on the official Unturned discord server or personally to me on my **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Y3jD5K2Q8C)**.

## Where can I suggest new ideas?

You can send your suggestions or issues on my **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Y3jD5K2Q8C)**, I daily check it while working on the module.

## I wanna support the development

Wow, really? That's so kind of you, for supporting the module you can contact me through **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Y3jD5K2Q8C)** and I can offer you different ways of supporting the development of this module.

## Resource name viewer

Same as in level objects you can see the name of the resource your mouse is at.

## Collection manager

This tool allows for real-time in-game editing of collections and foliage density. Changes are immediately visible and stored in memory, meaning they will revert if the game is restarted without saving. To make changes permanent, simply press the save button to write them to the game file.

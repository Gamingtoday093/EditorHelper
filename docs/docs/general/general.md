# General features

The module contains some features that aren't explicitly linked to any tool, here's a list of that features along some general information.

## Join Singleplayer

This button is visible at all times while editing a map, it lets you instantly join to the map in single player at the exact position you're on the editor, it asks you first if you wanna save the map.

While on the single player world, you'll see a **`Back to editor`** button to go back into the editor.

## Limit alerts

Unturned have some explicit limits of Spawns, Zombies, Roads, etc. but it doesn't have any restriction for this, saving a map that goes over this limits may corrupt your map, so **Editor Helper** contains checks for this along alerts so you know if you're over this limits.

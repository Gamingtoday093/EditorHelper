# Editor Helper
Simple module for Unturned 3 to use as a tool while developing maps.

# How to install
Download the lastest available .zip file at releases, go to your Unturned folder, Modules and extract the zip there.
Now start the game with BattlEye disabled and you can start using the module! ^^

# Features
The module is a work in progress and features will be added as I upload more updates :)
At the moment the module features are:
- Highlight objects by type. *(Select an object and highlight all the same objects in the map with a counter displaying how much objects of this type were highlighted)*

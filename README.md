# Editor Helper
Simple module for Unturned 3 to use as a tool while developing maps.

# How to install
Download the lastest available .zip file at **[gumroad](https://seniors.gumroad.com/l/editorhelper)**, go to your Unturned folder, Modules and extract the zip there.
Now start the game with BattlEye disabled and you can start using the module! ^^

# Features
The module is a work in progress and features will be added as I upload more updates :)
At the moment the module features are:
- Highlight objects by type. *(Select an object and highlight all the same objects in the map with a counter displaying how much objects of this type were highlighted)*
- Highlight color selector.
- Preview icon for selected object.
- Selection grid with icons for objects.
- Manual position, rotation and scale setters. *(Change the exact position, rotation or scale by changing the numbers like in Unity)*
- Road controls. *(Use the control arrows from objects with roads for better precision)*
- Road radius. *(See a circle around your road point with a **accurated** radius of the road material)*
- Road key binds. *(Ctrl+B and Ctrl+N support)*
- Filter objects by mod. *(Paste the mod ID and highlight all objects that are relative to that mod)*
- Name nodes shown in world. *(Option to display a world label with the location name)*
- Adjacent placement. *(Ideal for roads)*
- Instant play. *(Join the world at the position where your camera is)*

# May I have already seen this before but with more features?
Yes, as far I know a module called Breakdown have been in the works before, but as posts on the Unturned discord relates, this have been a thing since 2023 with no public releases nor promoting that it's even avaliable, so due adding some tools isn't exactly a big deal and the community seems interested in this type of tools, I released a open source, free and public tool that may or may not contain the same tools but made by me.
